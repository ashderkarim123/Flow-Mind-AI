## How to Use These Files with RAG Chatbot

### For Knowledge Base Ingestion
1. Load all three markdown files into your RAG system
2. Index by sections and subsections
3. Create embeddings for semantic search
4. Set up retrieval with similarity matching

### For Query Handling
- **General Questions**: Use PROJECT_INFORMATION.md
- **Node-Specific Questions**: Use WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md
- **Technical/Architecture Questions**: Use TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Search across all files

### Example Queries
- "What are the available node types?" → WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md
- "How does authentication work?" → TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md + PROJECT_INFORMATION.md
- "What integrations are supported?" → PROJECT_INFORMATION.md
- "How do I configure the OpenAI node?" → WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md
- "What's the system architecture?" → TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- "How do I create a workflow?" → PROJECT_INFORMATION.md + WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md

## Updating These Files

When the project changes:
1. Update PROJECT_INFORMATION.md for general changes
2. Update WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md for node changes
3. Update TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md for architecture changes
4. Keep version numbers in sync
5. Update this README with new sections

## Related Files in Root

- **questions.txt**: 250 frequently asked questions (no answers)

## Integration with RAG Systems

### Recommended Setup
```
RAG System
├── Knowledge Base
│   ├── PROJECT_INFORMATION.md
│   ├── WORKFLOW_NODES_GUIDE.md
│   └── TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
├── Embeddings
│   └── Vector database with semantic search
├── Retrieval
│   └── Top-k similarity matching
└── Generation
    └── LLM with context from retrieved docs
```

### Retrieval Strategy
1. User query → Embedding
2. Search knowledge base → Top 3-5 relevant sections
3. Combine with system prompt
4. Generate response with LLM
5. Include source references
