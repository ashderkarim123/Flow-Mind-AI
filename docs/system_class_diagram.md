## Key Interactions

### Workflow Creation Flow
1. User initiates workflow creation via UI
2. WorkflowService receives request
3. Workflow model created in database
4. AuditService logs activity
5. NotificationService sends confirmation

### Workflow Execution Flow
1. ExecutionService receives trigger
2. Loads workflow definition from WorkflowService
3. Executes each node sequentially
4. Records metrics in AnalyticsService
5. Handles errors with retry logic
6. Sends notifications for completion

### Marketplace Transaction Flow
1. User browses templates in MarketplaceService
2. Initiates purchase through BillingService
3. Payment processed by payment gateway
4. Purchase recorded and template installed
5. AuditService logs transaction
6. NotificationService sends receipt
